        <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard language used to create and structure web pages.
        It defines the content and layout of a webpage using a system of tags and elements.
        HTML works alongside <b>CSS</b> for styling and <b>JavaScript</b> for interactivity.
        The latest version, <b>HTML5</b>,introduces features like semantic elements, multimedia support (audio & video),
        and improved accessibility, making web development more efficient and user-friendly.

    <h2>History of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML was first developed by <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in <b>1991</b> as a simple markup language to structure and
        share documents over the <b>World Wide Web</b>. The first version,<b>HTML 1.0</b>, was very basic, supporting only simple text formatting and links.
        Over time, HTML evolved to accommodate the growing needs of web development. In 1995, <b>HTML 2.0</b> was introduced, standardizing the language and 
        adding support for forms and tables. By 1997, <b>HTML 3.2</b> brought advancements like improved table structures, scripting support, and image alignment.

        The major breakthrough came in <b>1999</b> with the release of <b>HTML 4.01</b>, which introduced better multimedia handling, support for <b>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</b>, 
        and a stronger focus on structured web content. However, as the internet expanded, developers required more powerful features. In <b>2008, HTML5</b> was introduced,
        revolutionizing web development with semantic elements, built-in audio and video support, enhanced accessibility, and improved performance. HTML5 remains the foundation of 
        modern web applications, working alongside <b>CSS and JavaScript</b> to create highly interactive, responsive, and dynamic websites.
