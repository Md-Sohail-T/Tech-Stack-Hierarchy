        <b>Bootstrap</b> is a popular, free, and open-source front-end framework for building responsive, 
        mobile-first websites and web applications, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and offering pre-styled
        components and a grid system to simplify web development. </p>
    
        <h2>History of BootStrap</h2>
    <p>
        Bootstrap was created in 2010 by <b>Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton</b> at Twitter as an internal framework called <b>"Twitter Blueprint"</b> to
        standardize web development. It was later released as an open-source project on GitHub on August 19, 2011, gaining rapid popularity
        due to its ease of use and responsive design. With <b>Bootstrap 2 (2012)</b>, it introduced <b>mobile-first</b> responsiveness,
        and by <b>Bootstrap 3 (2013),</b> it fully embraced a <b>flexible grid system.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        In <b>Bootstrap 4 (2018),</b> the framework switched from <b>LESS to Sass</b>, adopted <b>Flexbox</b>, and dropped support for older browsers
        like <b>Internet Explorer 9 & 10</b>. The latest major version, <b>Bootstrap 5 (2021),</b> removed <b>jQuery dependency</b>, improved <b>CSS grid layouts</b>, 
        and introduced enhanced utility classes for better customization. Today, Bootstrap continues to evolve, focusing on <b>performance, accessibility, and modern web development trends.</b>
