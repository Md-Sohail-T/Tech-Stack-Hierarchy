       <b>Java</b> is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its <b>platform independence</b>,
        meaning it can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It follows the <b>"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)</b>
        principle, making it a popular choice for web applications, enterprise software, mobile apps (Android), and backend development.
        Java is widely used due to its robust security, scalability, and strong community support. It is the foundation of many large-scale applications,
        including <b>banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and cloud computing services.</b>

    <h2>History of JAVA</h2>
    <p>
        Java was created by <b>James Gosling</b> and his team at <b>Sun Microsystems</b> in 1991 under the project name Oak,
        initially designed for embedded systems and interactive television. However, it was later renamed <b>Java</b> and officially released
        in 1995. Over the years, Java has evolved significantly, with major updates improving <b>performance, security, and functionality</b>. 
        In 2010, Oracle Corporation acquired <b>Sun Microsystems,</b> taking over Java's development. 
        Today, Java remains one of the most widely used programming languages, powering everything from <b>mobile apps to large-scale enterprise solutions.</b>
