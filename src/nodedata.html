        Node.js is an <b>open-source, server-side runtime environment</b> built on <b>Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine</b>. 
        It allows developers to run JavaScript outside the browser, making it ideal for <b>backend development, APIs, and real-time applications</b>.
        Node.js is known for its <b>asynchronous, event-driven architecture</b>, which makes it highly efficient for handling multiple requests at once. 
        It is widely used for building scalable, high-performance applications, including <b>chat applications, streaming services, and microservices architectures.</b>

    <h2>History of NodeJS</h2>

    <p>
        Node.js was created by <b>Ryan Dahl</b> in <b>2009</b> as a solution to handle <b>high-concurrency applications efficiently</b>. Traditional web servers struggled with handling
        multiple connections, so Node.js introduced a <b>non-blocking, event-driven model</b> that allowed it to process requests asynchronously. Over time, it gained popularity among developers,
        leading to a thriving <b>Node.js ecosystem</b>, including the <b>npm (Node Package Manager),</b> which provides thousands of reusable modules. Today, Node.js is maintained by the <b>OpenJS Foundation</b> and continues
        to be a dominant choice for modern <b>web development, backend services, and real-time applications.</b>
