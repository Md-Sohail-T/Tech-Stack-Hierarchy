        <b>JavaScript</b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language that enables interactive and dynamic web development.
        It was created in <b>1995 by Brendan Eich</b> at <b>Netscape Communications</b> to enhance web pages with interactivity. 
        JavaScript works alongside <b>HTML and CSS</b>, forming the foundation of modern web development.

    <h2>History of JavaScript</h2>
    
    <p>
        In <b>1997</b>, JavaScript was standardized by <b>ECMA International</b> under the name <b>ECMAScript (ES)</b>. 
        Over the years, JavaScript evolved significantly, with major updates such as <b>ES6 (2015)</b> introducing powerful features
        like <b>arrow functions, promises, classes, and modules</b>. Modern JavaScript now supports
        <b>asynchronous programming, frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, and server-side development with Node.js.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Today, JavaScript is a core web technology alongside <b>HTML and CSS</b>, enabling developers to create <b>dynamic, interactive, and high-performance web applications</b> 
        across browsers and platforms.
