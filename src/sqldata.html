       <b>MySQL</b> is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) widely used for storing, managing, and retrieving structured data. 
       It follows the <b>client-server architecture</b> and uses <b>Structured Query Language (SQL)</b> to interact with databases. 
       Known for its speed, reliability, and scalability, MySQL is commonly used in <b>web applications, enterprise systems, and cloud services</b>. 
       It supports features like <b>ACID compliance, transactions, indexing, and replication,</b> making it a preferred
    choice for applications requiring high performance and data integrity.

    <h2>History of MySQL</h2>
    
    <p>
        MySQL was developed in <b>1995</b> by <b>Michael Widenius, David Axmark, and Allan Larsson</b> at a Swedish company called <b>MySQL AB</b>. 
        It was designed as a <b>fast and lightweight database solution</b> for web applications. In 2008, Sun Microsystems acquired MySQL AB, and later in
        2010, Oracle Corporation took over Sun Microsystems, becoming the official maintainer of MySQL. Over the years, MySQL has evolved with improvements in
        <b>performance, security, and scalability,</b> making it one of the most widely used databases globally, powering platforms like <b>Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.</b>
