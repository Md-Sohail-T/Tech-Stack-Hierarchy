        <b>MongoDB</b> is a <b>NoSQL, open-source database</b> designed for handling large volumes
        of unstructured and semi-structured data. Unlike traditional relational databases, 
        MongoDB stores data in <b>JSON-like documents</b> instead of tables, making it highly flexible,
        scalable, and efficient for modern applications. It supports horizontal scaling, high availability,
        and automatic sharding, making it ideal for <b>big data applications, real-time analytics, and cloud-based services.</b>
        MongoDB is widely used in <b>web development, IoT, mobile apps, and content management systems</b> due to
        its ability to handle dynamic and rapidly changing data structures.

    <h2>History of MongoDB</h2>
    
    <p>
        MongoDB was created in <b>2007</b> by <b>Dwight Merriman, Eliot Horowitz, and Kevin Ryan</b> at <b>10gen (now MongoDB Inc.)</b>
        as a solution for handling large-scale data efficiently. It was officially released as an <b>open-source project in 2009,</b> gaining
        popularity for its <b>scalability and document-based model.</b> Over the years, MongoDB has evolved with features 
        like <b>Atlas (a cloud-based database service), ACID transactions, and enhanced security,</b> making it one of the most widely used
        NoSQL databases today, powering applications for companies like <b>Adobe, eBay, and Coinbase.</b>
