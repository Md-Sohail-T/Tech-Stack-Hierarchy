        <b>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</b> is a <b>styling language</b> used to control the visual presentation
        of web pages. It was introduced in <b>1996</b> by the <b>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</b> to separate content
        from design, making websites more flexible and easier to maintain. CSS allows developers to define styles for
        <b>colors, fonts, layouts, spacing, and animations</b>, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across different devices.

    <h2>History of CSS</h2>
    <p>
        The first version, <b>CSS1</b>, provided basic styling options such as font properties, colors, and spacing. In <b>1998, CSS2</b> introduced more advanced layout
        controls, including <b>positioning, z-index, and media types</b>. However, it wasn't until <b>CSS3</b>, released in the early 2000s, that major improvements revolutionized
        web design.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over time, CSS has evolved significantly. The introduction of <b>CSS3</b> brought powerful new features such as 
        <b>flexbox, grid layouts, animations, transitions, and media queries</b>, enabling responsive web design. With CSS, developers can create modern,
        dynamic, and interactive interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes, making it an essential tool in front-end development.
        Today, CSS continues to be a core technology of web development, working alongside <b>HTML and JavaScript</b> to enhance user experience and design consistency.
