        Django is a <b>high-level Python web framework</b> designed for fast, secure, and scalable web development. 
        It follows the <b>Model-View-Template (MVT)</b> architecture and comes with built-in features like authentication,
        an admin panel, and an <b>Object-Relational Mapper (ORM),</b> reducing development time. 
        Django is widely used for <b>web applications, APIs, e-commerce sites, and social media platforms</b> due to its security and efficiency.
        It is also highly scalable and powers major websites like <b>Instagram and Pinterest.</b>

    <h2>History of Django</h2>
    <p>
        Django was created in <b>2003</b> by <b>Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison</b> while working at a newspaper company to manage content-heavy
        websites efficiently. It was officially released as an <b>open-source project in July 2005</b>, quickly gaining popularity for its <b>“batteries-included”</b> approach,
        meaning it comes with essential features built-in. Over the years, Django has evolved with regular updates, improving security, performance, and ease of use.
        Today, it remains one of the most popular web frameworks for <b>modern, high-performance web applications.</b>
