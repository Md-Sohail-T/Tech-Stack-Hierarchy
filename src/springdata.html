        <b>Spring Boot</b> is an <b>open-source Java framework</b> built on <b>Spring</b>, designed to simplify the development
        of <b>standalone, production-ready applications</b>. It eliminates the need for <b>complex configurations</b> by providing auto-configuration,
        embedded servers (like Tomcat), and an opinionated setup. Spring Boot enables developers to build <b>microservices, web applications, 
        and enterprise-level systems</b>with minimal effort, making it a popular choice for modern <b>cloud-based and distributed applications.</b>
    </p>

        <h2>History of Spring Boot</h2>
   
    <p>
        Spring Boot was introduced by <b>Pivotal Software</b> (now part of VMware) in 2014 to address the complexity of configuring Spring applications.
        It was created to simplify development by <b>reducing boilerplate code and configuration</b>. Over time, it has become a key framework for building microservices architectures,
        integrating seamlessly with cloud platforms like <b>AWS, Azure, and Kubernetes.</b> Today, Spring Boot remains one of the most widely used frameworks for rapid Java application development,
        ensuring efficiency, scalability, and ease of deployment.
